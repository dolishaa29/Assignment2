# Tutedude Python Assignment 2 â€“ Module 3: Control Structures in Python

This repository contains Python scripts developed for **Assignment 2** of the **Tutedude Python Programming Course**, based on **Module 3: Control Structures in Python**. The goal of this assignment is to enhance understanding of conditional statements and loop structures, which are fundamental to writing logical and efficient code in Python.

The assignment consists of two tasks. **Task 1** focuses on conditional decision-making using an `if-else` statement. The program accepts an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd. Based on the result, it prints an appropriate message to inform the user. This task emphasizes the use of modulus operations and conditional branching to handle logical decisions in code.

**Task 2** is designed to demonstrate the use of loops in Python. Specifically, the program uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50, summing all integers in this range. The final output displays the computed sum to the user. This exercise highlights the effectiveness of iterative control structures in solving repetitive problems, a crucial concept in algorithm development.

The repository includes two individual Python files for each task along with this `README.md` file. Each script is written in Python 3 and structured to be clean, readable, and beginner-friendly. Input validations and result formatting are incorporated where necessary to improve user experience and ensure program correctness.

To use the programs, simply clone the repository and run the `.py` files using any Python 3 interpreter. This assignment serves as a hands-on application of control structures, helping learners gain confidence in implementing basic logic-based programs using conditional statements and loops.
